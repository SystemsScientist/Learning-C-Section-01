The Art of Writing Software

	- Create software that controls hardware
	
	- Use a programming language such as C
	
	- Other languages include C++, Java, Python, PHP, etc.


Programming Process

	- Source code --> Compiler --> Object code --> Linker --> Create program --> Test program


Source Code I

	- Plain text file
	
	- Can use any text editor to create this file


The contents are written in the programming language using the language's rules, syntax, and
formatting


Source Code II

	- Ends with the .c filename extension
	
	- Contains programming instructions


Object code

	- Compiled from the source code file
	
	- The C language compiler -> cc - c compiler
	
	- Contains tokenized instructions
	
	- Ends with the .o filename extension


The Linker

	- Often done as part of compiling
	
	- Combines object code and C library file
	
	- Creates a binary, executable file


Programming Cycle

	- Edit --> Link and Compile --> Test
