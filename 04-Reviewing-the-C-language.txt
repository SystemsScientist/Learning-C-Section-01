Reviewing The C Language
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The C Language

	- Computer programming language
	
	- Parts of speech: structure, syntax, rules
	
	- Can get really cryptic


Parts of the C Language

	- Data types
	
	- Operations
	
	- Keywords
	
	- Functions
	
	- Structure


Data Types

	- Variables and constants
	
	- Basic types: char, int, float, double
	
	- Qualifiers: short, long, signed, unsigned, const


Operators

	- Mathematical: +, -, /, *, %
	
	- Assignment: =, and so on
	
	- Relational: >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=
	
	- Conditional: ?:
	
	- Logical: &&, ||
	
	- Bitwise: &, |, ^, <<, >>, ~
	
	- Unary: &, *, ++, --, sizeof


Keywords

	- There are 44 (See a table)


Functions

	- True workhorses of the C language
	
	- Held in C Libraries
	
	- Defined and supported by header files
	
	- Thousands and thousands of functions


Structure and Syntax I

	- Preprocessor directives, header files, and macros
	
	- External objects, variables, and declarations
	
	- The main() function
	
	- Other functions


Structure and Syntax II

	- Statement ending in a semicolon ;
	
	- Statement execution is top-down
	
	- Blocks of statements grouped between braces { and }
	
	- Constructions enclosed in parentheses ( and )
	
	- Whitespace: spaces, tabs, new lines (Enter key press)
